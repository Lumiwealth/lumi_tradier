# tradier

Python wrapper for the tradier brokerage API

All functions can be imported from main.py with: `from main import *`

Class based functionality currently in development. Code is found in tradier.py


To get tradier.py to work, need to have 'tradier_acct' and 'tradier_token' defined in a .env file in the same directory.
